# VoiceRecognitionPython
In this project you talk to a microphone and the programm can do three different things depending on what you say. It can either shut down your computer, tell you a joke or play one of my favourite songs. I used python as the programming language. I also used the 'speech_recognition', 'os', 'pyaudio', 'pyttsx3', 'sys', 'winsound', 'pyjokes' libraries.
